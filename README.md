# Statistical Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and statistical projects completed using Python, Excel, and Tableau. Each folder below contains a standalone project with data, code, and visualizations.

## Projects

ðŸ”¹ [Fitlife Project](https://github.com/Eriyon24/statistical-projects-README.md/blob/main/Fitlife.ipynb)  
Predicting gym membership churn using logistic regression and decision trees.

Key Findings
Note: This project uses the FitLife dataset, which is artificial/simulated. Results do not reflect real-world patterns but demonstrate statistical analysis and visualization skills.

Steps vs Calories:
Weak negative correlation (-0.12). More steps did not always mean more calories burned, likely because non-step activities (e.g., swimming, cycling) still burn calories.

Sleep vs Daily Steps:
Correlation was almost zero (0.00). Sleep hours did not predict daily activity levels â€” people could sleep longer but still take fewer steps if they chose low-step workouts.

Day of Week Activity:
Average steps varied by day. Some days (e.g., weekends) showed higher activity, while others (e.g., weekdays) were lower. This highlights behavioral patterns in activity scheduling.

âœ… Takeaway:
Even with artificial data, this analysis shows how to:

Clean and process time-series health data

Use correlation and scatterplots for relationship testing

Group by categories (day of week) to find behavioral trends

ðŸ”¹ [Movie Analysis Project](https://github.com/Eriyon24/statistical-projects-README.md/blob/main/Movie_Project.ipynb)  
Exploring IMDB data using exploratory analysis and regression.



ðŸ”¹ [Web Analytics Project](https://github.com/Eriyon24/statistical-projects-README.md/blob/main/Web%20Analytics.ipynb)  
Analyzing website traffic data to identify user behavior patterns.
